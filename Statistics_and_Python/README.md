# 📊 Statistics and Python Applications

A collection of projects, notebooks, and experiments combining **statistical theory** with **Python implementation**.  
Each notebook bridges mathematical intuition with computational practice — showing how core statistical ideas can be applied, simulated, and visualized in code.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This repository aims to **connect theory and practice** in modern statistics.  
Every project starts from a mathematical foundation, develops the formulas step-by-step, and then uses Python to:
- simulate data,
- estimate parameters,
- visualize results,
- and test statistical properties empirically.

It’s designed for students, analysts, and researchers who want to understand *why* statistical methods work — not just how to call them from a library.

## 🧮 Topics Covered

### 📈 Core Statistics
- Probability distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Normal, etc.)
- Estimation theory (bias, variance, MLE, method of moments)
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
- Sampling theory and the Central Limit Theorem

### 🧠 Inference & Bayesian Methods
- Frequentist vs Bayesian estimation  
- Likelihood, prior, and posterior analysis  
- Conjugate priors (e.g. Beta–Binomial, Normal–Normal)
- Simulation-based inference (Monte Carlo, posterior sampling)

### ⚙️ Applied Python Techniques
- Data simulation with **NumPy** and **SciPy**
- Visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Regression and modeling with **scikit-learn**
- Interactive notebooks with **Jupyter**
